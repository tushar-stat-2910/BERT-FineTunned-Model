If you prepare the data for the entire dataset first and then run predictions in batches, it can improve performance because:

Preprocessing Overhead: Tokenization and preparation of data (like adding attention masks, truncation, and padding) happen only once for the entire dataset, rather than repeatedly in smaller chunks during the prediction phase. This reduces the overhead of repeatedly invoking the tokenizer for every batch.

Efficient Memory Usage: While predictions are made in batches (to avoid memory overflow), you still leverage the batch-based efficiency of TensorFlow/Keras without having to repeatedly tokenize the data.

Key Changes:
Preprocessing Entire Dataset: The prepare_data_entire_dataset function tokenizes the entire dataset at once, storing all tokenized input IDs and attention masks in one step.

Batch Prediction: The make_predictions_batch function splits the already preprocessed dataset into batches and runs predictions on each batch. By batching the predictions, memory usage is controlled while improving prediction speed.

Benefits:
Single Pass Preprocessing: The tokenization and input preparation happen only once for the entire dataset, reducing overall processing time.
Efficient Memory Usage: Even though the data is prepared in advance, predictions are still made in batches, ensuring memory is not exhausted during the process.
Better Performance: Since data preparation is typically slower than prediction, preparing the data for the entire dataset in one go reduces the time spent on repetitive operations.
This method will give you the best of both worlds: fast preprocessing and efficient batch predictions. Depending on the size of your dataset and available RAM, you might need to fine-tune the batch size (64 is a good starting point).
